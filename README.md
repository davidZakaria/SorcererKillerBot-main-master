Sorcerer Killer Mb â€“ A Discord Bot for Playing Music in a Voice Channel

This bot accepts a query and scours YouTube to find the most applicable video or playlist. It extracts the audio from the videos it finds and then plays it back in the voice channel of the user that queried it, so discord users can enjoy their favorite videos while calling their friends! This bot is written entirely in JavaScript, and makes use of the dependencies yt-search, ytdl-core, and ytpl to find the YouTube videos based on the query. It then uses ffmpeg and opus to extract the audio and play it back in the call.
